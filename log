	C	Right now the program can do a small amount of physics (not user controlled yet)
	C	It can also Display text input when '/' is pressed.
	P	The plan is when the user adds an object, we make him enter all the associated properties
		before he 'plays' the simulation or add another object.
	P	I will try to add multiple property support once the program is able to accept and interpret
		single properties(THIS COULD TAKE TIME).
	P	He can keep added objects and giving them properties. Until he 'plays the simulation'.

	C	The plan was a fail. The code was getting messy. So I dropped the idea. We are back at the
		Original code
	P	The plan now is the read all the values from a text file (I am thinking of dropping force
		and mass for time being because the number of values the user has to edit will be too much
		due to lack of UI)
	C	The plan seems to work (read text file). The next thing I want is to give angle to velocity
		and acceleration. We will ignore morce and mass effects for now. The objective is to
		simulate motion in a plane.
